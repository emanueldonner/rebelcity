It's a place for spreading revolutionary ideas and organizing student-led protests. The challenge lies in the heavy presence of academic authority and the possibility of intellectual debates that could both bolster and undermine revolutionary ideals.'"

Holding the square could lead to a significant morale boost, yet the danger of a crackdown is ever-present.'

Coordinating with the workers' unions here could lead to organized strikes, disrupting the city's production and drawing attention to labor issues aligned with the revolution. It's an excellent venue for fostering solidarity and recruiting fervent supporters among the working class. Engaging with union leaders and rallying the workers can significantly bolster the movement's manpower and resources. However, such actions come with the risk of retaliation from corporate security forces and the potential for increased surveillance, so strategies must be crafted with care to avoid tipping the balance unfavorably."

Yet, the commercial nature of the Mall means that security is high, and any disturbance can quickly escalate into a public relations nightmare.'
